Thank you. Thank you so much. What a pleasure to be back in Australia, to be back at the Opera House. Thank you so much for coming out tonight. As Anna just said, I've written a novel, but I don't want to talk particularly specifically about the novel. Please buy it after if you feel inclined. But what I really want to do is to talk about some of the ideas behind the novel. And sometimes people say to me, you know, why did you even bother to write a novel? I thought you supposed to be a non fiction writer and the reason I wrote a novel.	final
